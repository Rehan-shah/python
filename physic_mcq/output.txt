A digital balance is used to weigh ingredients in a laboratory. When a weight is applied to the 
digital balance, an electronic circuit generates a current which is then converted into a digital 
readout on the display. 
 
The electronic circuit gives a current of 2.0 mA when a weight of 30 N is applied, and a current of 
0.5 mA when a weight of 5 N is applied.

moving, each carriage experiences an air resistance force of 85.0 N. Assume that there are no 
other significant resistive forces.
