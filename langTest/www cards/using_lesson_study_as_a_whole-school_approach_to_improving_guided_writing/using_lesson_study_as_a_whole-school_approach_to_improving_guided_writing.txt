    title "the educational challenge : Lack of engagement in writing"
    text "To address the issue of lack of engagement in writing among boys in Year 7, teachers can follow these steps:
Identify the root cause: Before implementing any solutions, it is essential to understand why the boys are reluctant to write. Conduct interviews or surveys to gather information about their interests, motivations, and concerns.
Use active stimuli: Encourage boys to participate in hands-on activities, such as drama activities, field trips, and creative writing exercises. These activities can help stimulate their interest in writing and provide opportunities for them to express themselves creatively.
Foster a supportive environment: Create a safe and nurturing environment where boys feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. Offer praise and constructive feedback to build their confidence and motivation.
Set achievable goals: Break down writing assignments into smaller, manageable chunks. Set clear expectations and deadlines to help boys stay focused and motivated.
Celebrate achievements: Recognize and celebrate even small successes to reinforce positive behavior and boost self-esteem. Consider hosting a celebratory event involving parents to showcase the boys' writing accomplishments.
By following these steps, teachers can help motivate boys who are reluctant to write and encourage them to become engaged and confident writers."

    title "Limited writing skills : childern reaction"
    text "As a student, I found the teacher's response helpful in addressing my limited writing skills. I appreciated the fact that the teacher took the time to assess my current skill level and provided scaffolding to help me improve. The demonstration of effective writing strategies during whole-class instruction was also very useful, as it helped me better understand the writing process and learn from others.
However, I was initially hesitant about receiving feedback on my writing, as I feared criticism and rejection. However, when the teacher provided detailed, constructive feedback on my work, I realized that she was not judging me but rather helping me grow as a writer. Her encouragement and guidance made me feel more confident in my writing abilities and motivated me to continue improving.
Overall, I felt grateful for the teacher's efforts to help me develop my writing skills and become a better writer. Her approach was both challenging and supportive, which allowed me to push myself beyond my comfort zone while still feeling valued and respected. I am excited to see how much I can improve over the course of the year."
