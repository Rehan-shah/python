    text "To address poor pupil behavior and absenteeism in mathematics classrooms, teachers can follow these instructions:
Establish clear rules and consequences: Teachers should establish clear rules and consequences for inappropriate behavior in the classroom. This includes setting expectations for participation, respect, and punctuality.
Engage students: Teachers should strive to create engaging and interactive lessons that keep students interested and motivated. This may include incorporating hands-on activities, games, and real-world examples into math instruction.
Monitor attendance: Teachers should closely monitor attendance records and take action when necessary. This may include contacting parents, working with guidance counselors, or implementing interventions such as after-school tutoring.
Build relationships: Teachers should build positive relationships with students, showing empathy and understanding while also maintaining firm boundaries. This helps foster a sense of community and belonging in the classroom.
Seek support: Teachers should seek support from administrators, colleagues, and other professionals when dealing with challenging situations. This may include requesting additional training or resources to better manage difficult behaviors.
By following these steps, teachers can help create a safe and productive learning environment that promotes academic achievement and personal growth."

    text "To increase student engagement in mathematics learning, teachers can follow these instructions:
Make mathematics relevant: Connect mathematical concepts to real-world applications and show how they relate to students' lives. Use examples and scenarios that are familiar and interesting to them.
Encourage active learning: Incorporate hands-on activities, group work, and discussions into your lessons. Allow students to explore and experiment with mathematical concepts rather than simply listening to lectures.
Provide scaffolding: Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks. Offer step-by-step guidance and provide opportunities for practice and feedback.
Foster collaboration: Create a collaborative learning environment where students can work together to solve problems and share ideas. Encourage peer teaching and learning.
Use technology effectively: Integrate technology tools such as graphing calculators, dynamic geometry software, and online simulations to enhance student engagement and deepen their understanding of mathematical concepts.
Differentiate instruction: Tailor your teaching methods to meet the needs of different learners. Provide multiple pathways for students to demonstrate their understanding and mastery of mathematical concepts.
By following these steps, teachers can help create a stimulating and engaging learning environment that fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills in mathematics."
