Additionally, I might feel embarrassed or ashamed if my behavior is singled out in front of the entire class. Overall, while the teacher's response is helpful, it's important to consider the individual needs and feelings of each student."

Encourage collaboration: Teachers should encourage collaboration between departments by creating opportunities for joint planning sessions, professional development workshops, and cross-departmental projects. This will foster a sense of community and build relationships between colleagues.
Provide training and support: Teachers should provide training and support to new staff members to ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the school's policies and procedures. This will help to prevent miscommunication and misunderstandings between departments.
Monitor and adjust as needed: Finally, teachers should monitor the effectiveness of their coordination efforts and make adjustments as needed.
